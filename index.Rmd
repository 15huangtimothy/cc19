# Intructions
This chapter gives you all the information you need to upload your community contribution. 


## Submission Steps

1. Fork [cc19 repo (this repo)](https://github.com/jtr13/cc19). More information about how to achieve this, please refer to [this tutorial](https://edav.info/github.html#branching-someone-elses-repo).
2. Clone/download the repo to your local computer.
3. Give your project a concise, descriptive name. For instance, name it `base_r_ggplot_graph` or sonething similar if your work is about constrasting/working with base R graphics and GGplot graphics. Your project name should be joined with underscores, i.e. **No whitespace in the name.** We will use `sample_project` as the name in this tutorial. 
4. Create a `Rmd` file, named after your project name. In our example, it should be `sample_project.Rmd`. Put it in the root directory of the repo. With regard to content of this file, you should refer to the instructions of this homework on coursework. Two more details on how you should organize this file: 
    1. No YAML header
    2. The first line should be your project name (this does not have to be exact same as the project folder name). Use one \# to indicate that it is a header. One \# header must not be used anywhere else in the document. For example:
    3. The second line should be blank. 
   ```
    # Base R graphics vs. GGplot graphics

    Your content starts here. 
   ```
5. [OPTIONAL] If you have other resources (such as images) included in your project, create a folder under `resources/`. In our example, it should be `resources/sample_project/`. Put the resources files here. 
6. When you are ready to submit your project, push your project folder to your remote repo. Follow [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to create a pull request. If you follow the steps, we will merge it to the master branch.
